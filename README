= Linqr

 Aims to bring Linq like sytax to ruby. I wish we didnt have learn different apis for querying an array and ActiveRecord model.
 Linq in C# was a great example of bringing a uniform query api to different sources of Data.



== Usage

numbers = [ 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 0 ]
    output =  _{ 
      from x
      in_ numbers
      where x > 1
      select x * 3
    }
    output.should == [15, 12, 9, 27, 24, 18, 21, 6]
